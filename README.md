<p>The world is full of fascinating places.Planning the perfect vacation involves pacing up, leaving home, and experiencing something new.</p>

<h2 class="destination">1. Venice, Italy</h2>

 <div class="description">Centuries-old architecture, cobblestone alleys, a maze of eye-catching islands, and of course, the famous canals that run through it all-Venice is quite literally unlike anywhere else. While the capital of the Veneto (one of the 20 regions in Italy) is undoubtedly a stunner, it’s also a very real city. The Grand Canal and Piazza San Marco are hotspots for visitors: Their winding streets are filled with cafes, gelaterias, and boutiques interspersed among Renaissance palaces and Gothic churches. But once you’ve ticked off the must-see landmarks (like St. Mark’s Campanile and the Gallerie dell'Accademia museum), explore lesser-known neighborhoods like Cannaregio, Dorsoduro, and Castellom, where locals crowd low-key trattorias for afternoon aperitivo. And don't miss the nearby islands. Just a short ferry ride away, you'll find Burano, which is known for its intricate lace and brightly colored houses, and Murano, world-famous for its vibrant, hand-blown glass.<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/venice" target="_blank">Learn More</a>
